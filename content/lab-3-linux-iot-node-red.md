#Lab 3 - Using Node-RED with Microsoft Azure IoT
![Node-RED](/images/node-red.png "Node-RED")

In this lab, you begin by learning what is Node-RED, and the basics of using it with a Raspberry Pi 3 that's running Raspbian. One of the major goals is to connect your device to the cloud by using a Node-RED node that allows you to connect with Azure IoT Hub.

### Lab 3.1: Getting Started With Node-Red
[In this lab](/content/lab-3-1-getting-started-with-node-red.md) you will install *Node-RED* and *Node-Red node for Azure IoT Hub*. You will interact with the Node-RED editor and understand how to create and design flows.

Estimated time to complete: **15-minutes**. 

### Lab 3.2: Create your first flow
[In this lab](/content/lab-3-2-creating-your-first-flow.md) You will learn about the basics of Node-RED flows, and create your first flow. You will understand the mechanics of the Node-RED editor, learn to deploy and run the flows.

Estimated time to complete: **10-minutes**. 

### Lab 3.3: Creating a more advanced Node-RED flow
[In this lab](/content/lab-3-3-creating-creating-a-more-advanced-node-red-flow.md) you will create a more advanced Node-RED flow. With this flow you'll get data from Internet (live UK total electricity consumption), process the values and understand if frequency is under 50 HZ or not.

Estimated time to complete: **20-minutes**. 

### Lab 3.4: 
[In this lab](/content/lab-3-4-azure-iot-hub-examples.md) you will create a flow to explore several ways to send data to Azure IoT Hub, using the Azure IoT node. You will send basic data - from strings to JSON payloads. You will also check how to monitor data in Azure IoT Hub with Device Explorer dfesktop app.

Estimated time to complete: **15-minutes**.
